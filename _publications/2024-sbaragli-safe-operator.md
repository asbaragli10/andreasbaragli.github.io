  The current shift in European demographic pyramids and the increase in the retirement age are posing serious challenges to the manufacturing sector. To address these social challenges, the recent Industry 5.0 paradigm is promoting human-centric value creation to achieve resilient and socially sustainable industrial environments. In this evolving scenario, this work conceptualizes the Safe Operator 5.0 digital architecture to safeguard the system and physical resilience of human-centric manufacturing environments leveraging three main layers. While workers are digitized through positioning, proximity, and physiological sensors, a machine learning-based cyber layer processes these data streams as well as managerial data to evaluate the efficiency and physical well-being of the workforce. Finally, a central management system provides feedback and early warning to final users.
