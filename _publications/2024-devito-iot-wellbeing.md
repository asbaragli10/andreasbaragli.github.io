  This paper proposes an Internet of Things-based system for monitoring the well-being of operators working in assembly lines. The system consists of two wearable devices, the former for the acquisition of physiological signals and the latter for the recognition of the operator postures. Furthermore, an Indoor Positioning System (IPS) is used for the real-time tracking of operators, tools, and components involved in the process. A preliminary metrological characterization of the system is performed on the heart rate (HR) measurements provided by the wearable electrocardiograph against a patient simulator, and the orientation measurements provided by the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Furthermore, the latency affecting the IPS is measured. To validate the correct functioning of the entire system, a preliminary experimental campaign is conducted where one operator assembles and disassembles an industrial pump.
