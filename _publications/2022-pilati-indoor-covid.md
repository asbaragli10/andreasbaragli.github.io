  Since the 11th of March 2020 when the World Health Organization declared the novel COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic, it registered officially over 5 million deaths worldwide. According to the course of the pandemic, governments encouraged best practices and then ruled out temporary restrictions on daily lives. In this scenario, non-essential labor-intensive sectors were forced to put on hold operations producing massive temporary layoffs. In gradually restoring the economic activities, governments passed several laws to passively mitigate the pathogen transmission in indoor working environments. However, several COVID19-related injuries were filled by manufacturing companies. According to the outlined conditions, this paper proposes an original and advanced hardware and software architecture to prevent the COVID19 transmission in indoor production environments. The aim is to increase the safety of whichever indoor productive workplace through a contact tracing approach. Indoor positioning systems due to their ability to accurately track the movement of tagged entities compose the hardware part. For this purpose, human operatives are equipped with adequate wearable sensors. Raw data acquired are properly mined through advanced algorithms to quantitatively assess the degree of safety of any working setting. Indeed, having as a reference the epidemiological evidence the software part defines an innovative risk index along two correlated dimensions. While the first defines the risk of any worker getting infected during the shift, the other one expresses the degree of COVID19-safety of the shop floor defined by the displacements of the anchors. Benefitting from these targeted and quantitative hints, plant supervisors may redesign the production settings to lower the chances of COVID19 infection. This innovative digital framework is validated in a real case study in the North of Italy which performs manual mechanical processing for the automotive industry.
